# Face and Eye detection-Webcam
This is a real time eye and face detction system created using the Haar Cascade Classsifiers widely used for object detection in real time. Open CV is used as the primary library to access the webcam and eye anf frontal face haar classifiers are used for real time detection. Even though the algorithm gives many false positives sometimes but it is the easiest way to implement object detection systems. Instructions about the code are given in the comments in the code.
